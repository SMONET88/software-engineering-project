# Scurry Betting 🌰 
*A beginner friendly, fun sports betting app*

Scurry Betting is a simple, approachable sports betting platform designed for users who want to learn how sports betting works without the stress of losing real money. Instead of cash, our app uses **Acorns**, our in-app currency that lets new bettors experiment, make mistakes, and enjoy the process in a safe, risk-free environment.

Our goal is to make sports betting **accessible**, **educational**, and **fun**. We focus on clear interfaces, easy to understand betting options, and features that help users feel confident even if they have zero experience with betting or sports.

## Key Features
- **Virtual Currency (Acorns):** Bet freely without real financial consequences.  
- **Beginner-Friendly Design:** No prior betting experience needed! 
- **Fun & Low-Pressure Experience:** Encourages fun rather than high stakes gambling.  
- **Simple, Usable Interface:** Built with clarity and accessibility in mind.
